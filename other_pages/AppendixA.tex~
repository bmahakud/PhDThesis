{\bf Multivariate Optimization for the W-tagging:}\\

As described in Section 5.4, a number of jet substructure observables are studied to distinguish
between a quark- or gluon-initiated jet and a jet coming from hadronic W boson decays.
Here, we optimize a set of observables to be used in the tagging of W-jets.
The final result will show that a small subset of very powerful observables can be
just as performant as a large set of observables. Optimization is performed using Monte Carlo events and the data-to-MC scale factors are then derived from the $t\bar{t}$ control sample. %The scale factors will be presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:ttbar}.
Optimization is performed for the $\rm H \to WW$ signal sample ($m_H = 600$~GeV) while the background is taken to be the W+jets sample. It is known that the performance of the W-jet tagging is dependent on the polarization of the W boson but our main conclusions will be derived from results on the Higgs decays.
%For $H \to WW$ at high Higgs masses, above $\sim 400$~GeV, the $W$ bosons are nearly 100\% longitudinally polarized.
%Further cross-checks are performed using RS Graviton decays to $WW$.
Basic selection cuts are applied to the samples to define a clean sample of W-jets are:
\begin{itemize}
\item $p_T$ of the leptonically decaying W is greater than 200 GeV.
\item $p_T$ of the hardest CA8 jet in the event is greater than 200 GeV.
\item Transverse missing energy (MET) is greater than 50 GeV.
\item $\Delta R_{l,j} > 1.0$; The distance between the lepton and the jet should be large.
\item $\Delta \Phi_{MET,j} > 2.0$; The azimuthal distance between the missing energy and jet should be large.
\item $\Delta \Phi_{V,j} > 2.0$; the azimuthal distance between the $W$ boson and jet should be large
\end{itemize}
%These same cuts are used in the analysis and will be reiterated in the following section, Sec.~\ref{sec:analysis}.
The optimization is performed starting with a small set of powerful observables and incrementally adding more observables.
Multivariate analysis is performed by combining these input observables into a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) using the TMVA analysis package and the detail can be found in the Ref.\cite {an-12-381}. Performance is evaluated in terms of the background rejection for a given signal efficiency.
A simple baseline set of observables is chosen of the following three observables: mass drop, Qjets volatility, and N-subjettiness $\tau_2/\tau_1$.
The ROC curve and signal efficiency versus background rejection, can be seen in the top left plot of Fig.~\ref{fig:ROCs1}. The effect of adding more observables can seen in the same figure.%, Fig.~\ref{fig:ROCs1}.
The top right includes the same three observables from the top left plot plus additional r-core variables.
The bottom left includes the same observables from the top right plot plus additional planar flow variables.
The bottom right includes the same observables from the bottom left plot plus additional subjet kinematic observables.
From Fig.~\ref{fig:ROCs1}, we see that the addition of more observables does not improve the discrimination power between the signal and background samples.
The observation of a slight degradation with the additional variables is due to overtraining without a large sample of simulated events.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:tmvaCorr}, the correlations between all the considered substructure observables for W-jet tagging are shown.
Considering results of the study adding more variables to the multivariate analysis, we now consider only three most powerful variables: mass drop, Qjets volatility, and N-subjettiness $\tau_2/\tau_1$.
From Fig.~\ref{fig:tmvaCorr}, we see that the mass-drop variable is highly correlated with $\tau_2/\tau_1$.

\end{figure}

In addition, we also include a more performant version of $\tau_2/\tau_1$.
%The definition of the N-subjettiness axes in the previous section used the axes defined by the declustering of the kT algorithm.
By optimizing the definition of the axes, the performance of the N-subjettiness algorithm can be improved.
We use what is called the ``one-pass" optimization.
The improvement in performance can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:t2t1_onepass}.

\end{figure}

In order to examine the individual performance of each observable, the ROC curves are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:ROCs3}.
The mass drop variable is shown to be least performant while both Qjets volatility, $\Gamma_{\rm Qjet}$, and $\tau_2/\tau_1$ perform similarly.
However, $\tau_2/\tau_1$ is performing better using the one-pass axis optimization.
Additionally we combine $\Gamma_{\rm Qjet}$ and $\tau_2/\tau_1$ into an MVA discriminant using BDT and Fisher discriminant (LD).
We find that using the $\tau_2/\tau_1$ with one-pass axis optimization is nearly as performant as an MVA discriminant.

From these studies, we conclude to use the $\tau_2/\tau_1$ observable with one-pass axis optimization.
%While being slightly less performant than a multivariate optimization, the ease of implementation and incremental
%difference from previous $W$-jet tagging analyses.
