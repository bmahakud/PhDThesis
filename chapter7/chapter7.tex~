\chapter{Search for Pair Production of First Generation Leptoquarks  \label{Search for pair Production of First Generation Lepto Quarks}}


Leptoquark pair-production at the LHC proceeds primarily through gluon-gluon fusion, with a smaller contribution from quark-antiquark annihilation.
Here, the leptoquark mass (M$_{LQ}$) and the Yukawa coupling $\lambda$ to leptons and quarks are relevant production and decay parameters.
The production cross section is nearly independent of $\lambda$.

A leptoquark will decay into a lepton and a quark, giving rise to a final state containing high-momentum leptons and jets.
The decay into a charged lepton and a quark has branching fraction $\beta$, while the decay into a neutrino and a quark has branching fraction $1-\beta$ ( $\beta$ is a free parameter). Previous searches for rare processes mediated by lepton number violation, and flavor-changing neutral currents prefer leptoquarks at LHC-accessible mass ranges that couple to leptons and quarks of
  the same generation without intergenerational mixing.%(no mixing)~\cite{Buchmuller,FCNC}. 
Therefore, we assume first-generation leptoquarks decay to electrons and electron neutrinos, leading to following three possible final states:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Two electrons and two jets: each leptoquark decays into an electron and a quark;
  \item One electron, MET, and two jets: one leptoquark decays into an electron and a quark, while the other decays into a an electron neutrino and a quark; and 
  \item No electrons, MET, and two jets: each leptoquark decays into a neutrino and a quark.
\end{itemize}
The final state branching fractions are $\beta^2$, $2\times\beta(1-\beta)$, and $(1-\beta)^2$, respectively.
We consider two values of $\beta$: 1, where leptoquarks always decaying to the first final state; and 0.5,
where 50\% of leptoquarks decay to the second final state, with 25\% decaying to the first and 25\% decaying to the third final states.
The first and second final states are denoted as $eejj$ and $e{\nu}jj$.
In this analysis, we search for leptoquark decays in the first final state only, $eejj$.

Previous searches have not detected any leptoquarks. Recently, CMS published a search ~\cite{CMS-PAS-EXO-12-041} using about 20~$\text{fb}^{-1}$ of 2012 LHC data recorded at $\sqrt{s}=8$~TeV, which gave first generation
leptoquark mass limits of less than 1010 (850) GeV for $\beta=1$ ($0.5$). %~\cite{exo-12-041-paper}.
  Similarly, ATLAS used the 2012 LHC data to set first generation leptoquark mass limits of less than 1050 (900) GeV for $\beta=1$ ($0.5$),
and also looked at the possibility of $\beta=0.2$, which yielded a mass limit of 900 GeV~\cite{atlasLQ8TeVpaper}.
All of the above limits are set at the 95\% CL.



\section{Event Selection}


The $eejj$ final state is the result of two pair-produced leptoquarks each decaying to an electron and a jet, where the branching fraction $\beta$ as defined previously is equal to 1. Events containing at least two electrons and two jets are selected, where the two leading $\rm p_{T}$ electrons and jets are used in the analysis.

\subsubsection{Preselection}
\label{subsubsec:eejjPreselection}
The preselection is aimed at selecting a background-dominated event sample in order to compare MC simulated background predictions with the data.
The corresponding selection requirements that the candidate event should
\begin{itemize}
  \item Pass the signal trigger satisfying the following criteria
    \begin{itemize}
     \item Single electron with online $\rm p_{T}$ greater than 27 GeV, and
     \item it has to satisfy loose identification criteria (loose means, loose compared to the offline HEEP criteria which will be defined later),
     

     \end{itemize}

  \item Contain exactly two electrons passing HEEP (High Energy Electrons) ID, additionally having ECAL cluster ${E_T} >$ 50 GeV and ECAL  pseudorapidity $|\eta| <$ 2.5 (HEEP selection criteria as listed in Table~\ref{tab:HEEP6cuts} gives high efficiency for high energy electrons),
  \item Contains no muons, where muons are selected with $p_T >$ 45 GeV and $|\eta| <$ 2.1,
  \item Contains at least two jets with $p_T >$ 50 GeV and $|\eta| <$ 2.4,
  \item Have $m_{ee} >$ 50 GeV, where $m_{ee}$ is the dielectron invariant mass, and 
  \item Have $S_T >$ 300 GeV, where $S_T$ is the scalar sum of  $p_T$ of the two electrons and the two leading jets.
  
\end{itemize}
After applying these criteria, the overall MC background agreement with the data is examined in a series of plots, we find a quite good agreement between the two. The data-MC agreement in terms of the last two variables above could be seen in Fig.~\ref{figure:DatavsBkgPreselection}. The ratio plots have been provided for a better view of the data-MC agreement.

\newpage
\subsubsection{Final Selection}
In order to maximize the  signal sensitivity, we have optimized a set of cuts on three variables. They are 
\begin{itemize}
 \item $S_{T}$,
 \item  $m_{ee}$ and
 \item  $m_{ej}^{min}$: As each leptoquark decays to an electron and a quark, when we choose the correct $e$ and $j$ pair, mass difference from the two reconstructed LQs should be very small. Out of two electrons and two jets we make four combinations to see which combinations gives minimum difference between the $m_{e,j}$ mass, the invariant mass of that particular combination is $m^{min}_{ej}$.
\end{itemize}

The variables $S_T$, $m_{ee}$, and $m_{ej}$ are varied independently over a broad range of values, and the thresholds which maximize the optimization metric are obtained for each leptoquark mass point. The considered metric is called `Punzi's significance~\cite{PunziSignificance} as given in Eq.~\ref{eq:punziOpt}, where $t$ represents an attempted set of cuts, $\epsilon(t)$ is the efficiency times acceptance of the signal, $a$ is the one-sided significance required in standard deviations, and $B(t)$ is the expected number of background events.  

%\begin{linenomath}
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{\epsilon(t)}{a/2+\sqrt{B(t)}}
    \label{eq:punziOpt}
  \end{equation}
%\end{linenomath}

We choose a = 5 to require 5$\sigma$ discovery significance. A unique property of the Punzi significance is that is does not depend on the signal cross section, but only on its acceptance times efficiency. The optimized set of cuts are shown in the Table ~\ref{tab:optimizedThresholds}.

\section{ Backgrounds}

The major backgrounds from SM processes are $Z+$jets and $t\bar{t}$, whereas single top, $W+$jets, diboson, and $\gamma$+jets contribute at a lower level. There is also an instrumental background from QCD multijet events with jets faking as electrons and passing the HEEP ID. Below we describe briefly about the estimation of QCD background as this is the part where we have maximally contributed. The QCD contribution to the signal region is small compared to $Z+$jets and $t\bar{t}$, however as QCD is one the less understood process, so a careful attention is needed to estimate background. We employ a fully data driven QCD estimation.

\subsection{QCD multijet:}
QCD events enters our signal region because of misidentification of jets are electrons. In other word, our HEEP criteria have a finite fake rate (FR). We define FR as the probability of a jet to be misidentified as an electron. Mathematically,

  \begin{equation}
    FR = \frac{N_{\rm pass,HEEP,jets}}{N_{\rm total,jets}}
    \label{eq:FakeRate}
  \end{equation}

As our signal region requires two electrons, we take a control sample of two electrons with very loose criteria imposed on them. Basically,  the control sample becomes a jet dominated region. Then we estimate the number of QCD events that contribute to the signal region 

   \begin{equation}
    N_{\rm QCD}^{eejj} = \sum_{\rm events} FR_{1}\otimes FR_{2}
    \label{eq:FakeRate}
  \end{equation}

where $FR_{1}$ and $FR_{2}$ are the fake rates of the two electrons. More details on the fake rate calculation can be found in Ref.~\cite{CMS-PAS-EXO-16-043}.


\section{Results and Statistical Interpretation}

Similar to the two SUSY analyses~\cite{CMS-PAS-SUS-15-002,CMS-PAS-SUS-16-014}, we observe no significant excess of events as compared to the SM backgrounds. A broad excess of the events that was seen in the 8 TeV analysis~\cite{CMS-PAS-EXO-12-041} has disappeared with the 2015 data. The data-MC agreement after the final selection for the LQ mass point of 650 could be seen from Fig.~\ref{figure:DataMCfinalSelection}. We set the upper limits on the cross section times branching fraction using the LHC style approach. Fig. ~\ref{figure:LimitLQ12016} shows the observed and expected limits for different LQ masses. We exclude LQ masses up to 1130 GeV from this study.
