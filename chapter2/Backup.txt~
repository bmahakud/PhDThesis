\subsection{Experimental Verification of the SM}
During the last forty years or so, the SM has been tremendously successful in explaining all the observed phenomena~\cite{collider-physics}. In the process of evolution, it has also predicted many new particles and phenomena. Most of the particles predicted by the SM have been discovered and the unknown processes have been measured precisely. Among the discoveries, the W and Z boson at UA1 and UA2 experiments at SPS, CERN in 1983 \cite {u1-collaboration1, u1-collaboration2, u2-collaboration1, u2-collaboration2}, the discovery of the top quark by Tevatron experiments at Fermilab in 1995 \cite{cdf-collab, do-collab}, and the discovery of a Higgs-like boson in 2012 by the ATLAS \cite{atlas-higgs} and CMS \cite {cms-higgs} experiments at LHC, CERN are the important milestones in particle physics. The mass of gauge bosons and their decay width were precisely measured by the LEP, SLC and Tevatron experiments. The masses of fermions and quark  mixing angles have also been determined experimentally. The Higgs boson is the key ingredient of the SM as it gives mass to all elementary particles. The recently discovered boson having its mass $\sim 125$ GeV by CMS and ATLAS experiments seems to be consistent with the Higgs boson. The latest measured values of SM parameters can be found in Ref.\cite {pdg}. 





\section {Going Beyond the Standard Model}
The SM along with Einstein's theory of general relativity provides us a remarkably simple framework to understand and explain almost all observed phenomena in nature. Still, there are many physical processes that we are unable to decipher within this framework. For instance, we are unable to explain physics happening at a shorter or similar distance than Plank scale, where gravity should be quantized. Further, experimental evidence for dark energy, dark matter etc, seems to escape from this framework and one needs to explore beyond it \cite {bsm}. In the SM, some of the couplings and masses determined by the experiments demand a better explanation, and this requires to some more fundamental theory. For a true unification of electroweak and strong forces, the renormalization group (RG) evolution of three coupling strengths corresponding to $\rm SU(3)_{C}$, $\rm SU(2)_{L}$ and $\rm U(1)_{Y}$ gauge groups should meet at a common point at a higher energy scale, the scale of Grand Unified Theory (GUT). However, given the high precision electroweak measurements and the particle contents of the SM, the RG evolution of three gauge coupling strengths fail to meet at a common point. In SM, neutrino is massless, however recent results on neutrino oscillation suggest that neutrinos have a tiny mass. Although, the SM is able to explain the phenomena of quark mixing and CP violation observed in K and B meson decays, it can't explain the baryon asymmetry in the universe.

Now a days there are several extensions to the SM proposed that try to solve above shortcomings. The front runner is the Supersymmetry (SUSY)\cite {susy-book}. Supersymmetry is a symmetry which relates fermions into bosons and vice versa. It predicts that there exists a superpartners to each and every known particle with a spin difference of 1/2. The important aspect of SUSY is that it can solve the naturalness or hierarchy problem \cite{hierarchy-prob}. There is the so called Minimal Supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model (MSSM), which assumes minimal gauge group, and the minimal particle content. The MSSM requires two isodoublets of complex scalar fields, the Higgs field, to break electroweak symmetry and generic masses. The two isodoublets must have opposite hypercharge to cancel chiral anomalies and to give mass to the up and down type of quarks, respectively. The prediction of a low mass Higgs in MSSM is quite important for the survival of low-energy SUSY models like MSSM and could be ruled out if such a Higgs boson is not discovered at the LHC.

Apart from these models, there are few others that also try to solve the shortcomings of SM. The Grand Unified Theory (GTU) \cite{gut} is one of them which tries to unify the SM gauge groups to a single, large symmetry group. The three gauge coupling strengths are unified to a single gauge coupling constant at a higher energy scale and as a consequence, it reduces the number of parameters in the model. There are also models that introduce extra space-time dimensions helping to solve the hierarchy problem \cite{extra-dim, mass hierarchy} in the SM. The LHC experiments are expected to provide answers to some of these questions.
